# Stock Journal

My all encompassing website to help with value investing in the stock market. 

It's hosted at [codefit.lol](http://codefit.lol/).

Ideas: 
    - Screens stocks based on [Gurufocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/) DCF valuations.
    - Gives you something to read on some sort of periodic basis (SEC filings, new Seeking Alpha articles, a good book)
    - Use in conjunction with Stock Pitcher (mobile app)
